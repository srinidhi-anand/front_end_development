# front_end_development

Design a website (using HTML, CSS and Django) with the following functionality:


The home page will have a button with the name "Get instant quote". On clicking this button, the user will be redirected to an "Upload" page which has another button "Upload 3D files". On clicking this button, user should be able to upload only 3D (STP) file. If the file upload succeeds, display 'Success' notification on the page. If the file upload fails, display a 'failure' notification on the page.
